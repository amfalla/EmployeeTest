# Employee Web App Test
## Requirements
This test was developed in ASP.NET MVC and WEB API using the .NET Framework 4.7.1. In order to execute the application you need Visual Studio 2017 with the latest framework. 
## Instructions
Once you download the source code you can open de “EmployeesWeb.sln” with Visual Studio 2017. 
In the Web.config you can configure the following:
*	Employees-Endpoint: you can configure this key in case you need to point to a different version of the backend service. 
*	You can configure the log4net section to be able to save any logging information of the application. Currently the app is only logging errors. The most important property of this section is called “file” where you can change the location of the log file.
